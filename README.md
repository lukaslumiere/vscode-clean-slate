## VS Code Clean Interface Settings

I'm sharing my `settings.json` file for VS Code, all focused on keeping things clean and clutter-free. If you're into that sleek, minimal look, here's how you can set it up:

1. **Open up Visual Studio Code.**
2. Head to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or just hit `Ctrl + ,`).
3. In the settings window, click the little sheet with a key icon at the top right (`Open Settings (JSON)`).
4. Paste in the code I'm sharing and save it.

**Boom!** You've got yourself a streamlined workspace. Enjoy the vibe!
